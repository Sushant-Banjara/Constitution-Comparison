Grenada 1973 (reinst. 1991, rev. 1992)
PREAMBLE
Whereas the people of Grenada
a.
have affirmed that their nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the fatherhood and supremacy of God and man’s duties toward his fellow man;
b.
recognise that, inasmuch as spiritual development is of supreme importance to human existence, and the highest expression thereof, it is their aspiration to serve that end with all their strength and resources;
c.
firmly believe in the dignity of human values and that all men are endowed by the Creator with equal and inalienable rights, reason, and conscience; that rights and duties are correlatives in every social and political activity of man; and that while rights exalt individual freedom, duties express the dignity of that freedom;
d.
express their respect for the rule of law; and since moral conduct constitutes the noblest flowering of their culture and their plural heritage, regard it as the duty of every man always to hold it in high respect;
e.
reiterate that the ideal of free men enjoying freedom from fear and want can be best achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic, social and political, civil and cultural rights;
f.
desire that their constitution should reflect the above mentioned principles and beliefs which represent those high ideals upon which their nation is founded, and make provision for ensuring the protection in Grenada of fundamental rights and freedoms:
Now, therefore, the following provisions shall have effect as the Constitution of Grenada:-
CHAPTER I. PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
1. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
Whereas every person in Grenada is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms, that is to say, the right, whatever his race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex, but subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest, to each and all of the following, namely-
a.
life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law;
b.
freedom of conscience, of expression and of assembly and association;
c.
protection for the privacy of his home and other property and from deprivation of property without compensation; and
d.
the right to work,
the provisions of the Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to those rights and freedoms subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in these provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the said rights and freedoms by any person does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.
2. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO LIFE
1. No person shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence under the law of Grenada of which he has been convicted.
2. A person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his life in contravention of this section if he dies as the result of the use, to such extent and in such circumstances as are permitted by law, of force such as is reasonably justifiable-
a.
for the defence of any person from violence or for the defence of property;
b.
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
c.
for the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection or mutiny; or
d.
in order to prevent the commission by that person of a criminal offence,
or if he dies as the result of a lawful act of war.

for the purpose of preventing the spread of an infectious or contagious disease;
h.
in the case of a person who is, or is reasonably suspected to be, of unsound mind, addicted to drugs or alcohol, or a vagrant, for the purpose of his care or treatment or the protection of the community;
i.
for the purpose of preventing the unlawful entry of that person into Grenada, or for the purpose of effecting the expulsion, extradition or other lawful removal of that person from Grenada or for the purpose of restricting that person while he is being conveyed through Grenada in the course of his extradition or removal as a convicted prisoner from one country to another; or
j.
to such extent as may be necessary in the execution of a lawful order requiring that person to remain within a specified area within Grenada, or prohibiting him from being within such an area, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for the taking of proceedings against that person with a view to the making of any such order or relating to such an order after it has been made, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for restraining that person during any visit that he is permitted to make to any part of Grenada in which, in consequence of any such order, his presence would otherwise be unlawful.
2. Any person who is arrested or detained shall be informed as soon as reasonably practicable, in a language that he understands, of the reasons for his arrest or detention.

and who is not released, shall be brought without undue delay before a court.
4. Where any person is brought before a court in execution of the order of a court in any proceedings or upon suspicion of his having committed or being about to commit an offence, he shall not be thereafter further held in custody in connection with those proceedings or that offence save upon the order of a court.
5. If any person arrested or detained as mentioned in subsection (3) (b) of this section is not tried within a reasonable time, then, without prejudice to any further proceedings that may be brought against him, he shall be released either unconditionally or upon reasonable conditions, including in particular such conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure that he appears at a later date for trial or for proceedings preliminary to trial.
6. Any person who is unlawfully arrested or detained by any other person shall be entitled to compensation therefor from that other person or from any other person or authority on whose behalf that other person was acting.
7. For the purposes of subsection (1) (a) of this section a person charged before a court with a criminal offence under the law of Grenada in respect of whom a special verdict has been returned that he was guilty of the act or omission charged but was insane when he did the act or made the omission shall be regarded as a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence, and the detention of that person in consequence of such a verdict shall be regarded as detention in execution of the order of a court.
