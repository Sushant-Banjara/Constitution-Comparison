The Federal law can fix for the issue of the implementing legislation a deadline which may not, without the consent of the Federal Council, be shorter than six months and not longer than one year. If a Land does not observe this deadline, competence for the issue of the implementing legislation passes from that Land to the Federation. As soon as the Land has issued the implementing legislation, the Federation becomes invalidated. If the Federation has not established any principles, Land legislation is free to settle such matters. As soon as the Federation has established principles, the provisions of Land legislation shall within the deadline to be appointed by Federal law be adjusted to the legislation as regards the principle law.

The conclusion of such agreements in the name of the Federation is, depending on the subject, incumbent on the Federal Government or the Federal Ministers.

4. Every ordinance issued in accordance with para 3 above shall without delay be submitted by the Federal Government to the National Council which if it is not in session at this time shall be convened by the Federal President, but if it is in session by the President of the National Council on one of the eight days following the submission.

In order that the resolution of the National Council may be adopted in time, the President shall at the latest submit the motion to the vote on the last day but one before expiry of the four weeks deadline; detailed provisions shall be made in the Federal law on the National Council's Standing Orders. If the ordinance is, in accordance with the previous provisions, rescinded by the Federal Government, the legal provisions which had been invalidated by the ordinance become effective again on the day of entry into force of the rescission.
5. The ordinances specified in para 3 above may not contain an amendment to provisions of Federal constitutional law and may have for their subject neither a permanent financial burden on the Federation nor a financial burden on the Laender or municipalities nor financial commitments for citizens nor an alienation of federal assets nor measures pertaining to matters specified in Art 10 para 1 subpara 11 nor, finally, such as concern the right of collective association or rent protection.

Retirement entails the termination of all service-related payments.
3. If it is not possible for a public employee to be appointed to his previous post because of the fulfilment of his membership duties, he is entitled to be assigned a reasonably equivalent - if he agrees, also a not equivalent - activity. The pay shall be determined by the activity actually performed by the employee.
ART 59B
1. To control the pay of public employees who have been elected members of the National Council or Federal Council, a Commission will be set up under the auspices of the Parliamentary Staff. The Commission consists of:

The Commission also gives opinions on such disputes arising between a judge and chamber or a commission within the meaning of Art 87 para 2 as well as on disputes arising between a member of the National Council or the Federal Council and the President of the National Council in the execution of Art 30 para 3.
3. The member of the National Council or Federal Council who is a public employee is obligated to inform the Commission each year about the arrangement he has made in respect of his leave of absence or retirement in accordance with Art 59a and how the work to be performed by him will be reviewed. Art 53 para 3 shall analogously apply to inquiries by the Commission. The Commission furnishes itself with Standing Orders. Each year, the Commission shall file a report with the National Council - as far as members of the Federal Council are concerned, with the Federal Council -, which shall be published.

The National Council vote requires the presence of at least half the members and a majority of two thirds of the votes cast.
