Matters of municipal, supra-municipal or provincial interest can be the subject of a referendum in the municipality, supra-municipal collectivity or province concerned. The rule referred to in Article 134 regulates the procedures and arrangements for the referendum.

ARTICLE 124
No member of a Community or Regional Government can be prosecuted or be the subject of any investigation with regard to opinions expressed and votes cast by him in the exercise of his duties.
ARTICLE 125
Members of a Community or Regional Government are tried exclusively by the appeal court for offences they have allegedly committed in the exercise of their duties. The same rule applies in the case of offences allegedly committed by members of a Community or Regional Government outside the exercise of their duties and for which they are tried during the exercise of their duties. As the case may be, Articles 120 and 59 are not applicable.
The law determines the manner of proceeding against them, both when they are prosecuted and when they are tried.
The law designates the appeal court that has jurisdiction, which sits in banc, and specifies its composition. The judgments of the appeal court can be appealed to the united chambers of the Supreme Court, which does not pronounce on the merits of the case.
Only the public prosecutor to the appeal court having jurisdiction may institute and lead criminal proceedings against a member of a Community or of a Regional Government.
Authorisation by the Parliament of the Community or Region, each one for matters of its concern, is required for any public prosecutor's request to refer the member concerned to a particular court or to discharge him, for his direct summons before the appeal court and, except in a case of a flagrant offence, for his arrest.
The law determines the procedure to be followed when Articles 103 and 125 are both applicable and when there is a double application of Article 125.
A pardon may be granted to a member of a Community or Regional Government convicted in accordance with the first paragraph only upon request by the Community or Regional Parliament concerned.
The law determines in which cases and in accordance with which rules injured parties may bring a civil action.
The laws referred to in the present article must be adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.
TRANSITIONAL PROVISION
The present article is not applicable to acts which have been the subject of a preliminary judicial investigation or to proceedings instituted prior to the entry into force of the law implementing the article.
In such a case, the following rule applies: the Community or Regional Parliament concerned has the right to indict members of their Government and to bring them before the Supreme Court. Only the united chambers of this court have jurisdiction to try ministers in cases covered by the criminal laws and by application of the penalties prescribed by such laws. The special Law of 28 February 1997 concerning the temporary and partial implementation of Article 125 of the Constitution remains applicable in such cases.
ARTICLE 126
Constitutional provisions that apply to members of the Regional and Community Governments, as well as the implementing laws referred to in Article 125, last paragraph apply equally to Regional secretaries of State.

The nomination can be rejected only in the manner specified by the law and with justification.
In the case of appointment of an appeal judge or of a judge of the Supreme Court, the general assembly of the court concerned issues a reasoned opinion in the manner specified by the law, prior to the nomination referred to in the preceding paragraph.

§ 5. The King, by common consent with the Community or Regional Governments concerned, can denounce treaties concluded before 18 May 1993 and covering matters described in § 3.
The King denounces these treaties if the Community or Regional Governments concerned invite him to do so. A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph establishes the procedure in the event of disagreement between the Community and Regional Governments concerned.
