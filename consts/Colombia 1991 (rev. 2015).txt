Competences may not be decentralized without the previous allocation of sufficient fiscal resources for their discharge.
The distribution of the resources of the General System of Shares of the Departments, Districts and Municipalities shall take place by sectors defined by statute.

The National Government shall define a strategy for monitoring, follow-up and comprehensive control with regard to the expenditure of the territorial entities with resources from the General System of Shares in order to ensure the fulfillment of the criteria for coverage and quality [of services]. This strategy must extend the space for citizen participation in respect of social control and accounting procedures.
In order to apply and fulfill the provisions of the preceding section the National Government shall, within a period not exceeding six months following the signing of this Legislative Act, adopt, among other things, the pertinent rules defining the situations in which the adequate provision of services incumbent on the territorial entities is at risk, the measures which may be taken to avoid such situations and the effective determination of the required corrective action.

TRANSITIONAL PARAGRAPH 4
The National Government shall define a number of criteria and transitional arrangements in the application of the results of the last census with the objective of avoiding negative effects resulting from the variations in the census data on the distribution in the General System of Shares.

Upon the initiative of the Government, a separate Act shall determine the distribution, objectives, purposes, administration, collection, control, efficient use and destination of the revenues resulting from the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources, laying down the conditions for participation of their beneficiaries. The totality of revenues, assignments, organs, procedures and regulations shall constitute the General System of Concession Fees (Sistema General de Regalías).
