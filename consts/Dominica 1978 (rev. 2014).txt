Dominica 1978 (rev. 2014)
PREAMBLE
Whereas the People of Dominica—
a.
have affirmed that the Commonwealth of Dominica is founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, faith in fundamental human rights and freedoms, the position of the family in a society of free men and free institutions, the dignity of the human person, and the equal and inalienable rights with which all members of the human family are endowed by their Creator;
b.
respect the principles of social justice and therefore believe that the operation of the economic system should result in so distributing the material resources of the community as to subserve the common good, that there should be adequate means of livelihood for all, that labour should not be exploited or forced by economic necessity to operate in inhumane conditions but that there should be opportunity for advancement on the basis of recognition of merit, ability and integrity;
c.
have asserted their belief in a democratic society in which all persons may, to the extent of their capacity, play some part in the institutions of the national life and thus develop and maintain due respect for lawfully-constituted authority;
d.
recognise that men and institutions remain free only when freedom is founded upon respect for moral and spiritual values and the rule of law;
e.
desire that their Constitution should make provision for ensuring the protection in the Commonwealth of Dominica of fundamental human rights and freedoms;
Now, Therefore, the following provisions shall have effect as the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica:
CHAPTER I. PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
1. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS

a.
life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law;
b.
freedom of conscience, of expression and of assembly and association; and
c.
protection for the privacy of his home and other property and from deprivation of property without compensation,
the provisions of this Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to those rights and freedoms subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in those provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the said rights and freedoms by any person does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.
2. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO LIFE
1. A person shall not be deprived of his life intentionally save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence under the law of Dominica of which he has been convicted.
2. A person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his live in contravention of this section if he dies as the result of the use, to such extent and in such circumstances as are permitted by law, of such force as is reasonably justifiable—
a.
for the defence of any person from violence or for the defence of property;
b.
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
c.
for the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection or mutiny; or

3. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO PERSONAL LIBERTY
1. A person shall not be deprived of his personal liberty save as may be authorised by law in any of the following cases, that is to say—

j.
to such extent as may be necessary in the execution of a lawful order requiring him to remain within a specified area within Dominica, or prohibiting him from being within such an area, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for the taking of proceedings against him with a view to the making of any such order or relating to such an order after it has been made, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for restraining him during any visit that he is permitted to make to any part of Dominica in which, in consequence of any such order, his presence would otherwise be unlawful.
2. Any person who is arrested or detained shall be informed as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any case no later than twenty-four hours after such arrest or detention, in a language that he understands, of the reasons for his arrest or detention.

3. The Chief Justice may make rules with respect to the practice and procedure of the High Court or, subject to such provision as may have been made in that behalf by Parliament, with respect to the practice and procedure of any other tribunal or authority in relation to the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by subsection (2) of this section or exercisable by the other tribunal or authority for the purposes of that subsection (including rules with respect to the time within which applications or appeals to the High Court or applications to the other tribunal or authority may be brought).
