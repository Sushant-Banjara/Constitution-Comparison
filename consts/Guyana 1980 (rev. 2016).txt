a.
votes shall be cast throughout Guyana in favour of lists of candidates;
b.
each elector shall have one vote and may cast it in favour of any of the lists; and
c.
the seats of the said elected members in the Assembly, as determined under this paragraph, shall be allocated between the lists in such a manner that the proportion that the number of such seats allocated to each list bears to the number of votes cast in favour of that list is as nearly as may be the same for each list, thus minimizing the level of disproportionality between the percentages of votes earned by lists and the percentages of seats allocated to lists in the cases of individual geographical constituencies, if they exist, and of the Assembly taken as a whole.
2. Parliament may make provision for the division of Guyana into such number of geographical constituencies, not being more than half the number of the elected members of the Assembly as Parliament may prescribe and for the election in each such constituency of such number of members of the Assembly as Parliament shall, subject to paragraph (4), prescribe; but, if Parliament makes provision as aforesaid, then-
a.
a person may stand as a candidate for election in any such geographical constituency only if, in such manner as Parliament may prescribe, he or she has declared that he or she supports, or has otherwise identified himself or herself with one and only one of the lists related to that geographical constituency, not with a list in any other geographical constituency; and not with any lists of another party; and
b.
those of the said seats in the Assembly as determined under paragraph (1), for which members are not elected in geographical constituencies as aforesaid shall be allocated between the contesting parties in accordance with the results of the voting throughout Guyana in favour of the lists of the contesting parties in such a manner that the proportion that the number of seats allocated to each party, when added to the number of members identified with that party's lists elected in the geographical constituencies, bears to the number of votes cast in favour of that party is as nearly as may be the same for each party, thus minimising the level of disproportionality between the percentages of votes earned by parties and the percentages of seats allocated to parties in the Assembly.
3. Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make provision-
a.
i.
for the registration of electors;
ii.
for the manner in which lists of candidates shall be prepared, including the provision in a list of the names of a sufficient number of candidates to enable any vacancies to be filled under subparagraph (vii), and which manner shall allow voters to be sure which individuals they are electing to the National Assembly;
iii.
for the manner in which the number of seats to be allocated to each list shall be calculated in order to give effect to the provisions of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as the case maybe;
iv.
for the combination of lists of candidates for the purpose of the allocation of seats (but not for the purpose of voting);
v.
for the extraction from the lists and declaration of names of the candidates who have been elected, and for such provision for extraction to take into account the proportion that women form of the electorate;
vi.
for the manner in which elections of members of the National Assembly shall be held pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2);
vii.
for the filling of vacancies among the seats of members of the National Assembly where such vacancies are caused otherwise than by a dissolution of Parliament;
viii.
generally for the conduct of elections of members of the National Assembly and for giving effect to the provisions of this Constitution relating thereto;
b.
i.
for the criteria for the participation of political parties in the general election;
ii.
for the formulae to be used to translate votes for a contesting party into seats for that party in the National Assembly;
iii.
for the minimum number or proportion of female candidates on a party's list and in all party's lists taken together;
iv.
for the minimum number or proportion of female candidates on a party's lists for geographical constituencies taken individually or together;
v.
for the maximum percentage or the number of geographical constituencies a party can contest in which its lists contain no female candidate.
4. The total number of seats in the National Assembly that are derived from geographical constituencies shall be such that the number of seats not derived from geographical constituencies is sufficiently large to correct any overall disproportionalities that might arise from the allocations of seats to geographical constituencies.
160A. POLITICAL PARTIES PROHIBITED FROM CAUSING ETHNIC DIVISION
1. All persons, institutions and political parties are prohibited from taking any action or advancing, disseminating or communicating any idea which may result in racial or ethnic division among the people.

The Standing Committee for Constitutional Reform shall, in addition to its functions under article 119A, continually review the operations of and the need for existing commissions and for the establishment of new commissions, applying the following considerations-

the issues to be addressed by a commission must be of national interest or affect a wide cross-section of the populace;

there could be disastrous consequences for the society and the country at large if the issues are not attended to and monitored;
c.
there is the assessment that it is important that political interference be eschewed in relation to the issues to be addressed;
d.
the operating procedures and mechanisms for choosing the members of a commission are such as would minimise the influence of the Executive and maximise public perception of impartiality in the operations of the commission;
e.
in accordance with the need for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, commissions should be kept small and be staffed by persons of appropriate skill and experience;
f.
where commissions, especially those of a protective nature as opposed to administrative commissions. are established to address similar issues, the limitations of human and financial resources should be considered and common secretariats should be established.
