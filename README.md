# Constitution-Comparison
A tad bit of text processing and turns out that the Somali Constitution is the most similar to that of Nepal. Given no ostensible social, cultural, economic, or geographic proximity of the two countries, the result may be hard to reconcile initially. However, if we consider the fact that both countries adopted their constitution after 2010, both were partly a result of civil war, and both focus on the administrative restructuring of the nation, things start making sense.

There are two files in this repository:

Text_to_CSV.ipynb is contains code for cleaning .txt files and combining all the constitutions to single csv format.

Constitution_Comparision. pdf contains R code and output for text analysis and comparision of the constituions.
